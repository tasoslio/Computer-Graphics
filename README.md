# Computer-Graphics
This assignment took place in the course "Computer Graphics" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at 8th Semester. It contains three parts which described below.

## :ledger: Description 
### Part 1 - Filling Triangles
This part implements scanline algorithm for filling triangles. It uses two methods for colouring the triangles:
1. Flat Method : This method applies a colour to each triangle based on the mean of the three colours of triangle's vertices.
2. Gouraud Method : This method applies a colour to each triangle's side based on the linear interpolation of the two colours of the corresponding vertices.

There are two different demo scripts that present the results of the two methods.
